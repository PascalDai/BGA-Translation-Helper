# Card strength 
Any card played on the location of its suit is a trump card. If both or neither card are trumps, then the one with the higher numerical value is stronger.

One trump card: 2 (Trump) is stronger than 4 ?
Two trump cards: 4 is stronger than 13

# Playing cards 
You can play a card on any one of the three locations. If you play a card on a location that has an unresolved card on it, you are attempting to counter it (see Countering cards). 2
If there is an unresolved card and you do not counter it then the player who played the card discards it and places a token on that card location (see Placing tokens).

# Countering cards and placing tokens 
You counter a card if you play a stronger card on the same location. If you do, discard both cards. 1
If you do not, discard the card that was not countered and place a token in that location. 2
Tokens mark your progress in each location.
Players can place up to the maximum number of tokens indicated on that location. Any tokens increasing the number of tokens over that maximum are disregarded. 3
